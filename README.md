## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Database Setup

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Once your project is ready, go to the SQL Editor
4. Run this SQL to create the transactions table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  kid_name TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (kid_name IN ('Holden', 'Maude')),
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('income', 'expense')),
  amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create an index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_kid_date ON transactions(kid_name, date DESC);

-- Enable Row Level Security (optional but recommended)
ALTER TABLE transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows all operations (adjust as needed)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations" ON transactions
  FOR ALL USING (true);
```

5. Go to Settings ‚Üí API in your Supabase project
6. Copy your project URL and anon key
7. Update the `.env` file with your credentials:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```
